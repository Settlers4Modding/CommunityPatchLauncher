# Contributing to Community Patch Launcher

This project is called _**Community Patch**_ and _**Community Patch Launcher**_ and the _Community_ within the name is meant!
If you like to contribute to the launcher or the patch any help is highly appreciated!

The whole source code of the Launcher can be found in our [Git], however the patch itself contains a set of different adjustments of the game The Settlers 4 History Edition.
Some changes only affect some config files, other changes are done much deeper in the code.
