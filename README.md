# Community Patch Launcher

This project is a launcher application for the Settler IV Community patch.
The whole source code can be found in our [Git].

## How to install this application

### Pre-Requirements

The Settlers 4 Community Patch currently only works for the History Edition. Other editions such as the Gold Edition are not yet supported.
The Community Patch Launcher is a Windows only application!
To install this application you will need the '.NET Framework 4.7' or newer. This is installed on Windows 10 by default.

### Installation

We offer two guides on how to install the patch. For a video guide just check out the video below.
If you prefer a written guide you can find it directly after.

#### Video Installation guide

This video currently demonstrates the installation with the old launcher which will be replaced soon.
Currently, this is the only possibility to use the Community Patch. Once the new launcher is released officially, there will be a new video.

**Step 3:** Double click CommunityPatchLauncher.exe.

**Step 4:** Before using the Community Patch you have to accept the agreement.

**Step 5:** Select the Installation folder of your Settlers 4 History Edition. This should normally work by hitting the "auto detect" button.

## Login functionality

It is **not** necessary for playing settlers 4 with the Community Patch to make use of the login functionality!

It is also not necessary to create an account for logging in. The launcher will just take your Uplay ID without fetching your password.
For players who make use of the login functionality we offer additional functionality such as
* Ranked Mode - Compete with other Players in the ranked system. New seasons will be started frequently, so it is never too late to begin! *(Coming soon)*
* Match searching functionality for the ranked mode - No need for searching players in forums and discords to compete! *(Coming soon)*
* Voting on Maps - You really liked a singleplayer or multiplayer map? Let others know and rate the map with 5 stars! *(Coming soon)*
* Chat functionality - Discuss things like PTR Balance changes with other players within the launcher!
* *(Coming soon)*

You can log in by hitting the button *(Coming soon)*.
