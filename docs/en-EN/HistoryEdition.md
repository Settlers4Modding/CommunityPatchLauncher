# History Edition

With this setting you play the original game as delivered by Ubisoft.
This is the right version to pick if you want to play multiplayer with people who do not use the Community Patch.

In general, we suggest not to use this version as it contains bugs and unwanted restrictions.
At least using the CP light is suggested for having the bug fixes without any balance changing.
