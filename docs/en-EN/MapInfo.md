## Maps
The Settlers 4 History Edition already offers a set of maps. However, after playing a while you will run out of new maps to play.
Fortunately, there is a Website where players upload their self-designed single- and multiplayer maps in a huge variety, free to use for everyone.

## Where can I find new maps?
The most recent maps can be found here: https://www.siedler-maps.de/s4maps/search.htm.
To look for only specific maps such as multiplayer, you can use the [Mapsearch].


## How do I install new maps?
1. Download the map
2. Check the format: Only files of type .map will work.
3. Save the map to the right folder (\Map\User). To open the folder, you can use the button below!

## Please avoid the most common mistakes:
* For playing multiplayer with a new map, all players have to download the map and save it to the right folder. There is no automatic map sharing functionality in the Setters 4 History Edition.
* For playing multiplayer all players have to save the map in the same folder. If one saves it to \Map\User and another one to \Map\Multiplayer it will not work. We recommend to always only use \Map\User for externally downloaded maps.
* Unfortunately there is 2 folders called \Map\User. One is in your installation directory, the other one can be found in the documents directory. All players of a multiplayer session must use the same directory. We recomment to always only use the directory where S4 is installed and not to use the documents folder.
