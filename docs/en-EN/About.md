# About (DE)

## Intentions
This project was started to provide the players a tool which is able to automatically install the Settlers 4 Community Patch and apply updates.
Additionally, the launcher should make it possible to switch between the patched version of Settlers 4 and the Vannila History Edition freely.
A launcher which existed before was no further improved and should be replaced by a more modern tool. For example the old launcher was able to patch the Settlers 4, but was not able to delete plug-ins once shipped. This led to issues which could be solved by manually deleting the plugins, but that was an unpleasant and very unnecessary experience for unexperienced users.
At the beginning of this project a lot more ideas came up that would be possible with the new launcher. One example would be that it is currently worked on a ranked system which would need authentification of participating players.

Targets of this project are:
* Creating a tool to patch from S4 History Edition to Community Patch level and vice versa.
* Avoid technical issues that came with the old launcher.
* Providing the base for new features.
* Enable the community to participate in the development more easily with GitHub.

## Supporters
A launcher would be nothing without content to patch! We are very thankful for all modders and content creators who provide us their plug-ins and mods!

The Settlers 4 Community Patch uses self-written plug-ins or plug-ins from other modders.
All those plug-ins fall under GPLicense or LPGLicense and are therefore completely open source and free to use.

### Mod-API
For programming and usage we make use of the Mod-API of Nyfrk.
